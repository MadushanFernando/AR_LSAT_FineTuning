				"explanation": "If both work on same day and each performs two tasks, that means this two crew members will do four tasks in two days. Therefore they should be capable of four tasks when put together. George and Maricita is capable of only 2 tasks together. Helena and Kelly capable of only three tasks together. Inga and Leanda only capable of four tasks together. But those four are wallboarding, framing, taping and priming. Since there should be atleas two tasks per two days and according to the order wallboarding and framing should be done on the first day and according to the rules taping can’t be done on the day that priming is done. Which means Inga and Leanda also not possible. Kelly and Leanda are capable of four tasks which are compatible. Leanda and Olaf also only capable of three tasks. Which makes the Answer D. {‘Answer’ : ‘D’}"

After Olivia and Ingrid there’s another person and after there’s Fiona. And there’s another person. After that person there’s another person who isn’t karl before harriet. Therefore   there’s no positon for peter to be in between Fiona and karl, Fiona and Olivia, Harriet and Ingrid or karl and manuel. Which makes answer A, B, C and E false. That leaves answer D. which means it must be the one that could be true. Therefore Answer is Answer D. {‘Answer’ : ‘D’}"

Fiona will be on 4. And since Harriet can’t be next to Fiona harriet won’t be on 3 or 5 which leaves only 2 and  6 for harriet. Since Ingrid sits immediately next to, and immediately clockwise from, Olivia, the possible assignments for Olivia and Ingrid in order of Olivia and Ingrid will be 1,2 or 2,3 or 5, 6 or 6,7. If Harriet is on 2 Ingrid and Olivia will be on 5,6 or 6,7 and If Harriet is on 6 Ingrid and Olivia will be on 1,2 and 2,3. Next to ingrid and Olivia will be kar and next to harriet will be Manuel and Peter. Which makes it impossible for manuel to be next to Fiona and Peter, George and Karl, George and Peter and Harriet and peter. It’s possible for manuel to be next to Fiona and Harriet and therefore the answer is Answer A. {‘Answer’ : ‘A’}"
