Therefore the days that will have a tour are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. The three divisions are Operations, Production, and Sales. Exactly five tours will be conducted that week, one for each day. Following are the rules that need to be followed: 1. Each division is toured at least once. 2. The Operations division is not toured on Monday. 3. The Production division is not toured on Wednesday. 4. The Sales division is toured on two consecutive days and on no other days. 5.

The first song performed is not performed on the flute. 2. If 'Sammy' is performed on the keyboard, then 'Rhino Rock' is performed on the harmonica. 3.

The song performed on the keyboard immediately follows 'Rhino Rock' and immediately precedes 'Night's All Right.'\n\nSince rhino rock, key board song and nights all right has to be consecutive in this order, if rhino rock is the second song third song will be on keyboard. Which means Answers A, B and C false. Since first song can\u2019t be on flute and third must be on keyboard first has to be on either guitar or harmonica. If Sammy is on keyboard Rihno rock is on harmonica which means night all right\u2019s on flute. If Question man is on keyboard night all right will be on flute and therefore Answer D is false.

After Olivia and Ingrid there\u2019s another person and after there\u2019s Fiona. And there\u2019s another person. After that person there\u2019s another person who isn\u2019t karl before harriet. Therefore   there\u2019s no positon for peter to be in between Fiona and karl, Fiona and Olivia, Harriet and Ingrid or karl and manuel. Which makes answer A, B, C and E false.

No three of Hamadi, Kurtz, Li, and Perkins can be appointed to the same court as each other.\n\nFirst let\u2019s list down facts. There are seven candidates for the position of judge. Candidates are Hamadi, Jefferson, Kurtz, Li, McDonnell, Ortiz, and Perkins. Each of them will be assigned to an open position on one of two courts. The two courts are appellate court and trial court. There are three open positions on the appellate court and six open positions on the trial court, but not all of them will be filled at this time. Following are the rules that need to be followed: 1. Li must be appointed to the appellate court. 2. Kurtz must be appointed to the trial court. 3. Hamadi cannot be appointed to the same court as Perkins.\n\nSince Li already appointed to the appellate court and kurt must be on trail court, only way to assign three of Hamadi, Kurtz, Li and Perkins to a single court is to appoint Hamadi and Perkins to a single court. So for the rule - No three of Hamadi, Kurtz, Li, and Perkins can be appointed to the same court as each other. To satisfy Hamadi and Perkins can\u2019t be in the same court. Therefore the answer is E. {\u2018Answer\u2019 : \u2018E\u2019}.\n"}]}
